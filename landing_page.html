    <h2>What Is TickyBot</h2>
    <p>TickyBot is a Slack Bot ðŸ¤– that lets you use support tickets on<br>
      Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to<br>
      assist your users, if you don't feel like it.</p>
    <p>With TickyBot you can easily check if you've received new tickets,<br>
      change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly<br>
      update itself on our site.</p>
    <p>Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages.</p>
